## *1. Introduction*
This report provides an in-depth analysis of scrap collection trends, revenue generation, and customer engagement using Power BI. The goal is to help stakeholders optimize operations and maximize revenue.

## *2. Data Sources*
The report is built using the following datasets:
- *Customers.csv* – Contains customer details.
- *Scrap_Transactions.csv* – Records all scrap collection transactions.
- *Franchise_Partners.csv* – Information about franchise partners.
- *Scrap_Categories.csv* – Categorization of different scrap types.

## *3. Data Cleaning & Transformation*
- Ensured correct data types (Date, Number, Text).
- Removed null values and duplicates.
- Established relationships:
  - Customers[CustomerID] → Scrap_Transactions[CustomerID]
  - Scrap_Transactions[ScrapType] → Scrap_Categories[ScrapType]
  - Scrap_Transactions[Location] → Franchise_Partners[Location]

## *4. Key Metrics (DAX Measures)*
The following DAX measures were created to track performance:

- *Total Revenue:*  
  TotalRevenue = SUM(Scrap_Transactions[TotalAmount])

- *Total Scrap Collected (kg):*  
  TotalScrapCollected = SUM(Scrap_Transactions[Weight(Kg)])

- *Average Price per Kg:*  
  AvgPricePerKg = AVERAGE(Scrap_Transactions[PricePerKg])

- *Top Customers (by Scrap Volume):*  
  TopCustomers = TOPN(10, VALUES(Customers[Name]), SUM(Scrap_Transactions[Weight(Kg)]), DESC)

- *Profit Margin Analysis:*  
  ProfitMargin = (SUM(Scrap_Transactions[TotalAmount]) - SUM(Scrap_Transactions[Cost])) / SUM(Scrap_Transactions[TotalAmount])

- *Revenue Growth Rate:*  
  RevenueGrowth = (SUM(Scrap_Transactions[TotalAmount]) - CALCULATE(SUM(Scrap_Transactions[TotalAmount]), PREVIOUSMONTH(Scrap_Transactions[TransactionDate]))) / CALCULATE(SUM(Scrap_Transactions[TotalAmount]), PREVIOUSMONTH(Scrap_Transactions[TransactionDate]))
